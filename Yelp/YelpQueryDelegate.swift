/**
The `YelpQueryDelegate` protocol defines methods that are called by the `YelpQuery` object in response to important events regarding the query executed against the [Yelp API v2.0](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview).

Overview

You use the methods of the query delegate to obtain information about progress the query execution has made or to handle events when query execution is finished with a success or failure.
